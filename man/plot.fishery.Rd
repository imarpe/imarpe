\method{plot}{fishery}(x, language = "spanish", ploType = NULL,
  daysToPlot = c(1, 8, 15, 22), textAxis2 = NULL, textAxis4 = NULL,
  colBar = "gray", colLine = "red", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of \code{fishing} class.}

\item{language}{A \code{character}. Define the language of text labels in plots.
It could be \code{"spanish"} or \code{"english"}.}

\item{ploType}{What type of plot should be draw. Possible types are:
\itemize{
  \item plotDaily for daily plot
  \item plotMonthly for monthly plot
  \item plotYearly for yearly plot
  \item plotPeru for all the peruvian region
  \item plotNC to graph the north-central region
  \item plotS to graph the south region
  \item plotJoined to graph the effort and landing
}}

\item{daysToPlot}{If is a daily plot by default the x-axis show the first day of a week
(1, 8, 15, 22) but could be change to show a specific day or to show the all days of the
data with \code{all}. This is including in a vector form.}

\item{textAxis2}{The text of the x axis.}

\item{textAxis4}{The text of the y axis.}

\item{...}{Extra arguments.}
}
\value{
A graph of the specified type in \code{ploType}.
}
\description{
This method takes a \code{fishery} object and make useful plots for
each variables (fishing lading and fishing effort). The plots can be daily,
monthly, yearly, over the peruvian region, and for north-central and south peruvian
region. An additional plot type to graph the effort and landing at the same time
using two y-axis.
